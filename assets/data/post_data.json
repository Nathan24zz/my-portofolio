    "detail_desc_2": "The habit of doing regular physical activity is a central protective factor for health. However, sometimes the motivation to engage in physical activity decreases with age. Luckily, this can be overcome by replacing the position of a physical trainer with a humanoid robot. The main difference between this study and some previous studies is comparing humanoid robot's pose with human's pose directly, which will be used in the process of mimicking of robots to humans. The main program in this study will be divided into 2 parts: <b>RECORD</b> and <b>PLAY</b> modes. In <b>RECORD</b> mode, human will do some poses and robot will imitate them while saving the movement. Whereas in <b>PLAY</b> mode, the robot will move according to the movements that have been stored in the previous mode and humans will imitate the robot's movements (the robot acts as a trainer). Then an assessment of human movement will be carried out based on robot movement using cosine similarity and the results will be obtained in percentage form. The greater the value, the more similar human pose and robot pose are, and vice versa. By using MediaPipe Pose for keypoint estimation in humans and RCNN Keypoint for robots, the created system is able to provide an accurate assessment of the similarity between the 2 poses.",

It is a minimalistic autograd engine implemented in Python. Autograd engine, short for automatic differentiation engine, is a crucial components in modern machine learning frameworks for computing gradients automatically. This project is built around a tiny computational graph, representing mathematical operations as nodes and their inputs and outputs as edges. By propagating gradients backward through this graph using the chain rule of calculus, it computes gradients efficiently for arbitrary functions composed of basic mathematical operations. This project will also help beginners and enthusiasts gain insights into how autograd engines work under the hood. At the end, there is also a comparison between this project and how to do it in PyTorch.",

    "detail_desc_2": "By default, PyTorch provides a Keypoint RCNN model which is pre-trained to detect 17 keypoints of the human body (nose, eyes, ears, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees and ankles). I fine tune the model using custom dataset that contains 6 keypoints of humanoid robot (head, trunk, right hand, left hand, right foot, left foot). Training keypoint estimation is a little bit harder than training object detection because the data has different format depending on the amount of the keypoint. Some of the framework are also only for human pose estimation that consist 17 keypoints so if we want to train with different keypoints, we need to fix it first before we can train the model. The custom dataset is a combination of NimbRo's HumanoidRobotPose dataset and my own dataset.
